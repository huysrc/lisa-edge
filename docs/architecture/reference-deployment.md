# Reference Deployment

This document describes the reference deployment used to validate LISA Edge.

The reference deployment is not a hard requirement. LISA Edge is hardware-independent and should remain portable across Linux hosts, virtual machines, and future hardware.

---

## Purpose

The reference deployment exists to provide a practical baseline for:

- testing installation flows
- validating Docker Compose services
- documenting network assumptions
- verifying backup and restore procedures
- confirming operational behavior after power loss or hardware replacement

Architecture should not depend on this specific hardware.

---

## Current Reference Hardware

The current primary reference target is:

- ZimaBoard 2 1664
- 16 GB RAM
- 64 GB eMMC
- Samsung SATA SSD for Docker data and persistent volumes
- UPS available
- Mellanox MCX312A-XCBT for future 10GbE networking

These details are deployment context, not architectural requirements.

## Storage Layout

Recommended layout:

| Storage                | Purpose                                                                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| eMMC                   | Rescue OS, recovery environment, emergency maintenance                      |
| SATA SSD               | Primary Ubuntu Server installation, Docker volumes, persistent service data |
| NAS / External Storage | Backups, archives, restore images                                           |

Avoid heavy writes to eMMC.

High-write workloads should use SSD or external storage.

---

## Service Placement

LISA Edge should run lightweight, infrastructure-critical services:

- OTBR
- MQTT
- NUT
- DNS helpers
- NTP / Chrony
- reverse proxy
- VPN endpoint
- Uptime Kuma
- backup and restore helpers
- health checks

Heavy workloads should run elsewhere:

- LLM inference
- ASR / TTS processing
- video analytics
- object detection
- large databases
- NAS workloads
- media storage

---

## Network Placement

LISA Edge should be placed on a trusted infrastructure or service VLAN.

Recommended principles:

- VPN-first administration
- SSH key authentication
- no public admin dashboards
- firewall allow-lists between VLANs
- least-privilege service exposure
- explicit access rules for sensitive networks

High-sensitivity networks such as alarm, access-control, camera, and management VLANs should receive additional protection.

---

## Recovery Expectations

A reference deployment should be recoverable from documented source-controlled configuration and backups.

Minimum recovery expectations:

- host can be reinstalled from documented bootstrap flow
- Docker services can be redeployed from Compose files
- secrets are restored from a secure backup process
- persistent volumes are restored from backup
- Thread dataset backup and restore are documented
- health checks confirm service readiness

The goal is not clustering for its own sake.

Priority order:

1. backup
2. restore
3. reliability
4. failover

---

## Validation Checklist

Before treating a deployment as production-ready, verify:

- [ ] host boots without keyboard or monitor
- [ ] SSH works with key authentication
- [ ] Docker services start after reboot
- [ ] persistent data is on SSD or external storage
- [ ] backups run successfully
- [ ] at least one restore test has been performed
- [ ] OTBR dataset backup exists if Thread is enabled
- [ ] monitoring detects failed services
- [ ] VPN access works without exposing admin dashboards publicly
- [ ] firewall rules preserve VLAN boundaries

---

## Non-Goals

The reference deployment should not turn LISA Edge into an all-in-one server.

Avoid adding services only because the hardware can run them.

Every service should answer:

- Does this improve local availability?
- Does this improve reliability?
- Does this improve security?
- Is the operational complexity justified?
- Can it be backed up and restored cleanly?
